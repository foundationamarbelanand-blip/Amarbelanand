        Mahatma Amarbelanand Ji, the visionary founder of the Amarbelanand
        Foundation, was born in Mumbai, Maharashtra, and pursued his Bachelor of
        Science from Mumbai University. Gifted with an exceptionally sharp
        intellect, he initially aspired to pursue MBBS and serve society as a
        doctor. However, a life-transforming encounter with a revered saint
        ignited in him a deep spiritual calling. This path led him to receive
        initiation into higher knowledge from Sadgurudev Shri Satpal Ji Maharaj,
        which inspired him to embrace renunciation and dedicate decades to
        sharing spiritual wisdom.His unceasing quest for the Supreme Truth
        culminated in direct realization through the infinite grace of the
        Supreme Father God. Empowered with this divine command, he founded the
        Amarbelanand Foundation, wholly committed to delivering free,
        compassionate, and divinely guided services in Healthcare, Education,
        and Welfare. Beyond social service, the foundation carries the higher
        mission of offering spiritual guidance, reconnecting humanity with
        eternal truth, liberation, and divine love — fulfilling the will of the
        Supreme.
